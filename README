Objective-C class that abstracts the logic of loading data into a UITableView from an asynchronous source in a paginated (piecemeal) manner.

Built because I saw that I was about to write this code at work, and I didn't want to have to type it all out a million times, so I made a nicer abstract controller to reduce the workload.  BSD licensed so I can use it at work, at play, and everywhere else.

See the example code for ideas of how it's used.  Feel free to modify it to your heart's content.  If you'd backport any of those modifications back to me, I'd absolutely love that, but it's not required.

Happy coding!
