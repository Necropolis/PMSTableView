# PMSTableViewController

PaginatedMultiSourceTableViewController (`PMSTableViewController`) is an Objective-C class that abstracts the logic of loading data into a `UITableView` from an asynchronous source in a paginated (piecemeal) manner.

I built this because I saw that I was about to write this code at work, and I didn't want to have to type it all out a million times, so I made a nicer abstract controller to reduce the workload. This is BSD/MIT dual-licensed so I can use it at work, at play, and everywhere else; consequentially, you can use it, too.

Please see the example code for ideas of how it's used, and feel free to modify it to your heart's content. If you'd backport any of those modifications back to me, I'd absolutely love that, but it's not required.

Happy coding!

## Basic Usage Overview

There is one main class that you need to know about: `PMSTableViewController`. This class contains the logic that detects when the user has scrolled to the end of a list of items and then runs off to fetch more data from your code.

You communicate with `PMSTableViewController` by implementing `PMSTableViewControllerDelegate`. From here you can return the proper data to the `UITableView`, generate your own `UITableViewCell`s (style them, inject edit hooks, etc) and otherwise do a lot of different things.

Each `PMSTableViewController` splits the `UITableView` into one or more sections. Each section represents a different source of data. I could be loading data from a network connection, from a large file, or by randomly generating numbers. The advantage of having multiple data sources for a single table is that it allows you to combine two views into one (where this makes sense).

`PMSTableViewController` is in essence an easy framework to implement "infinite scrolling" on the iOS. It doesn't try to load any more data until it needs to.

I think I'm correct in saying that `PMSTableViewController` isn't really the easiest to understand piece of code out there. However, if you ever find yourself in a situation of needing what it offers, then you will completely understand it. It will save you quite a lot of time and typing! However, I believe that I'm also correct in saying that `PMSTableViewController` is a bit of a niche tool; not many people even have the need of it.

## Future Features

What would I like to add in the future (approximately whenever I get a mythical Round Tuit)?

* Inject a loading cell while loading more content.
* Refactor how new cells are injected. I'm downright certain I'm not doing it in the best way.
* Build a few more examples to make it easier to deduce how to use it.
